##  About Me

I design and build **AI-driven software systems, autonomous developer tools, and production-grade web/mobile applications**.

My focus lies at the intersection of:

- Autonomous AI agents
- Developer tooling
- Real-time distributed systems
- Full-stack architecture
- LLM integrations and orchestration

I enjoy solving problems where **architecture, UX, and intelligence converge** — building products that move from idea → system design → shipped production software.

Currently working on:

- Autonomous AI Development Systems
- AI Mobile Applications
- Agentic Workflow Automation

---

##  Engineering Philosophy

- Systems > Features
- Architecture > Framework hype
- Developer Experience matters as much as performance
- AI should act as an operator — not just autocomplete

I prefer building **modular, observable, scalable systems** rather than isolated prototypes.
