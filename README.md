# Hi, I'm Mokshith Rao (@5mokshith)

I’m a final-year Computer Science Engineering student who enjoys turning ideas into real projects.  
Over the past few years, I’ve been exploring **Web Development**, experimenting with **Machine Learning**,  
and contributing to **Open Source** whenever I can.  

For me, coding isn’t just about solving problems—it’s about creating something meaningful, learning along the way,  
and sharing knowledge with others.
